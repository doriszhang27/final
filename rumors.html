            <strong><p class="f50">Definintion of Rumors:</p></strong>
            <p class="f20" text-align="left">A rumour is a tale that is passed down from person to person, explaining events that involve a product, occasion, or problem, but it may not be true.

            The topics of misinformation and disinformation are also frequently brought up in relation to rumours.

                    <strong><p class="f50"> The Cause of Rumors:</p></strong>
                <p class="f20"><strong>Uncertainty and ambiguity:</strong> When there is an absence of precise information, people could turn to rumours to help them understand the situation and fill in information gaps. For example, when an earthquake or strikes. People might not be aware of the whole scope of the rescue activities or the damage. Rumours can be relied upon by people in these circumstances to fill the knowledge gap.</p>
                <p class="f20"><strong>Desire for connection:</strong> Human need connection with others and sharing the same information is one of the most common way to make people feel connected. Sometimes, when the official information is scarce or inaccessible, people may see rumors and conspiracy theory as their source of information, for example, people tend to rush for the information and updates, even if they have not proven true yet. They desire to share their feeling and analysis on something happening online so that they feel connected. </p>
                <p class="f20"><strong>Misinterpretation and miscommunication:</strong> miscommunication means to communicate mistakenlly, unclearly or inadequately. Misinterpretation  meanns to interpret, explain, or understand incorrectly. Misunderstanding, misinterpretations and miscommunition may be created during the process from person to person, which leads to the spread of inaccurate or misleading rumors, for example, a message is whispered down a chain of people in the telephone game, it's frequently changed or entirely misinterpreted during the game.  </p>

                   <strong><p  class="f50"> The Influences of Rumors:</p></strong>
                        <p class="f20"><strong>Reputation and credibility:</strong> that are untrue or unfavourable can harm a person's reputation and have an impact on both their personal and professional life. </p>
                        <p class="f20"><strong>Emotional and psychological effects:</strong>Those who are the target of rumours or those who believe and disseminate them may experience intense emotional reactions in response to them. Untrue or unfavourable rumours can make the people concerned feel anxious, upset, angry, or ashamed. Furthermore, rumours have the power to instill a sense of unease, anxiety, and elevated feelings in societies or local communities.</p>
                        <p class="f20"><strong>Social dibitions and conflicts:</strong> Prejudices, stereotyping, and discrimination can be made worse by rumours that target particular communities or groups because of their colour, religion, or other distinctions. Additionally, rumours have the power to incite animosity amongst people or organisations or to escalate tensions between opposing forces.</p>
                        <p class="f20"><strong>Disruption of relationships and trust:</strong>Rumours have the power to destroy confidence and strain relationships between people, within groups, and between institutions of society. Rumours have the potential to sow distrust and mistrust, which can break down trust between friends, coworkers, and even between the public and their government.</p>
                        <p class="f20"><strong>Economic consequences:</strong> A company's bottom line may suffer from unfavourable rumours regarding its capacity to make ends meet, retain consumers, or maintain its financial health. </p>
                        <p class="f20"><strong>Spread of misinformation:</strong> Unchecked rumours have the potential to aid in the spread of inaccurate or misleading information. This may make it more difficult to make well-informed decisions, to solve problems, and to spread confusion throughout society.</p>

                    <p  class="f50"><strong>The Definition of Misinformation:</strong></p>
                        <p class="f20">Misinformation is wrong information, or the facts that people are misinformed. Sometimes, it may refers to the information intended to deceive.</p>

                        <p  class="f50"><strong>The Cause of Misinformation: </strong></p>
                        <p class="f20"><strong>Lack of credible sources:</strong>When there is a lack of credible information, people could distribute material that hasn't been thoroughly investigated or fact-checked or they might turn to dubious sources. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, People may spread information they have heard from friends without checking the veracity or correctness of the source. </p>
                        <p class="f20"><strong>Social media and online platforms:</strong>Because of the speed and ease with which content can be shared on digital platforms, disinformation can spread fast and widely. For example, Tom Cruise has been told about reports of his death in a plumbing accident in 2010, and many people believed that he was dead.</p>
                        <p class="f20"><strong>Echo chambers and filter bubbles:</strong> People frequently surround themselves with like-minded people in online platforms and participate in communities or echo chambers that support their preexisting values and opinions. This can lead to "filter bubbles," where people are mainly exposed to material that supports their preexisting opinions, which facilitates the spread of false information without critical examination. For example, some scholars are still doing reasearch on whether digital misinformation affected the outcome of the 2016 U.S. election and this shows how echo chambers affect rumors.

                    <p  class="f50"><strong>The Influences of Misinformation:</strong></p>
                        <p class="f20"><strong>Public opinion and decision-making:</strong> Exposure to inaccurate or misleading information has the potential to modify an individual's attitudes, behaviours, and beliefs. This in turn may have an impact on personal preferences, public opinion, and policy decisions.</p>
                        <p class="f20"><strong>Health and safety:</strong> Inaccurate or deceptive information on medical procedures, vaccinations, or public health initiatives can result in negative behaviours, a decline in confidence in medical professionals, and a compromise of public health initiatives.</p>
                        <p class="f20"><strong>Trust in institutions and experts:</strong> False stories have the power to exacerbate already-existing tensions, polarise communities, and incite animosity between various groups. This has the potential to erode social cohesiveness and impede attempts at mutual understanding and collaboration.</p>
                        <p class="f20"><strong>Misallocation of resources: </strong>When misleading information expands, it can erode trust in reliable information sources, fostering distrust and cynicism. Long-term effects on the public's trust and the capacity to effectively address societal issues may result from this.</p>
                        <p class="f20"><strong>Spread of fear and anxiety:</strong>People's concerns and anxieties are frequently exploited by misinformation, which amplifies emotional reactions. Misinformation or overstatement of possible hazards, perils, or emergencies may be a factor in the generalised anxiety.</p>
